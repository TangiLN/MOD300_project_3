# MOD300_project_3
Repository for the subject MOD300, Applied Python Coding and Modeling. For the third project. 

In this project we are going to study different methods to approach the volume of spheres in a 3D simulation box. First We are going to set up the box  and implement different function to create sphere and random points. After we are going to use the Monte Carlo method to approximate the total volume. 

In a second part of the project we are going to use another method, the walkers method. It consist in creating many walkers in a simulation and make them walk inside the box and store the path to know how much space is empty and to be able to deduce the volume oh sphere inside the box. 

The project is divided in 3 different .py files, the first is "Simulation_box.py" it contains the class simulation_box and 2 function to launch simulation easily. The second is "Shapes.py", it contains the class Point and Sphere that we use in the simulation box.
The last file is "test_box_simulation.py", wich contain the tests function of the simulation box that we implemented.
